this is a html file... 

did i come to the next line if I typed in the next line?

<p>"p" paragraph tag is for creating paragraphs</p>

<b>"b" This tag is to use for bolding text</b>

<p>However bolding text doesn't make any meaningful value like element whose name clearly describes its meaning and purpose</p>


<p>So we use "strong" tag which clearly indicates the importance of the text like <strong>Never give up!!</strong></p>

<p>Another method of emphasising a text is like using italic tag "i" <i>dear me</i>, but it doesn't bear the value of emphasising it like its not a semantic tag. instead we can use "em" tag<em>dear me</em></p>
