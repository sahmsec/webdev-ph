<p>We talk about anchor tag now which is used for link opening</p>

<p>anchor tag is represented by 'a' and it uses 'href' attribute to specify the link to be opened</p>
<a href="https://google.com">open google</a>

<p>now in order to open it in a diffrent tab once you click it you will just do tha following: <br> you will add target as "_blank" and for security you will add rel which means relation to "noopener noreferrer"</p>

<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">open google</a>
<p>now to open a file inside the folder, you can just give the path like /to/path</p>
<br>
<a href="/c2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open class 2 file</a>

<p><em>And just so you know, anchor is an <strong>inline</strong> tag</em></p>
