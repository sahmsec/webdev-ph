<p>Heading tag starts from "h1 to h6" and the larger the number, the smaller the size</p>
<p>Headings are also block elements too, they break the flow of a line if they are used</p>

<h1>Prime minister</h1>
<h2>Minister</h2>
<h3>Member of the parliament</h3>
<h4>Chairmain</h4>
<h5>Comissioner</h5>
<h6>Mango people</h6
<p>As you can see the size of the heading decreases as the number increases from h1 to h6 and if i use <h2>heading 2 here</h2>, it will break the line</p>
