<p>There are two kinds of list, one is unordered list and another is ordered list.</p>
<p>generally for listing we can  just use 'li' tag</p>
<li>item 1</li>
<li>item 2</li>
<li>item 3</li>

<p>But to make it more meaningful we use 'ul' tag for unordered list and 'ol' tag for ordered list</p>

<ul>
    <li>item 1</li>
    <li>item 2</li>
    <li>item 3</li>
</ul>

<p>
Similarly for ordered list we can do:
<ol>
    <li>item 1</li>
    <li>item 2</li>
    <li>item 3</li>

    <ol>
        <li>sub item 1</li>
        <li>sub item 2</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
Where the order does matter. list is also a block item.
</p>

<p>Now as we all know parargraph actually used to use new line as well as in a organized view, however in a single paragraph we could have multiple lines which needs new lines as well, but lets say its the same related content so there is no point of using another paragraph which we could absolutely do but we can use break tag "br" which will also do the same thing <br><br> as we can see this line starts from  a different line. and has two line gap between cause I used two br tag and it doesnt need ending tag and thats how it comes handy.</p>


<div>
    <h1>This is a heading inside of a division</h1>
    <ol>
        <h2>Ordered list inside of a division</h2>
        <li>item 1</li>
        <li>item 2</li>
    </ol>
    <p>here I am inside of a division which actually represents all the contents inside of it, which includes heading paragraphs list and so on.</p>
